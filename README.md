# Retinacheck-Secure-User-Authentication-app-with-Hypertensive-Retinopathy-Detection
In previous repositories, we developed a retinal fade image segmentation algorithm and a hypertensive retinopathy detection algorithm using AVR. Now we will create an application that has a complete authentication and account activation system via email. We will call on the model we imported to allow the authenticated user to upload an image and get an accurate classification. Then we will generate a result sentence to display the results to the user.

-->To open this project on localhost, you first need to activate a virtual environment with Django:

1->cd application_system

2->pip install virtualenv

3->virtualenv log

4->log/Scripts/activate   (<--with windows)    --OR--     source log/bin/activate     (<--with linux)

5->cd authentification 

6->python manage.py runserver

-->You will find some screenshots showcasing the interfaces.
